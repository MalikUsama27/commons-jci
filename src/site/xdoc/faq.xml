            <subsection name="Isn't compiler support integrated with Java6 (JSR199)?">
                Yes, it is now. JSR199 in the end brought the official java compiler tools that
                now come with Mustang. Progress on this had stalled for many years. This is how
                JCI was born. JCI provided what was missing from the JDK. And it still provides
                it also for earlier versions. The main author of JCI has later on joined the EG
                and will make sure there is a bridge to the JSR199 API. 
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Doesn't JSR199 already deprecate JCI?">
                Well, as said before ...there are no backports so far. And if you give the
                the final java tools API in Mustang a try you might well come back and
                enjoy JCI :)
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="How well tested is the code?">
                Well, there are a couple of projects out there using this code already for
                quite some time in production. Drools and Cocoon to name just a few well known Open
                Source projects. Code coverage is not bad at all ...but there still a few things
                on the TODO list and contributions are always welcome.
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Will the ... compiler be supported?">
                There is always room for new implementations. And if the compiler supports compilation to
                java bytecode, there is also a good chance it can be added. There are currently already a
                few potential candidates out there. But it all comes down to the need and the time to implement.
